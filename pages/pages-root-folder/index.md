# Welcome to the USTC FlyingCar Dataset!
##### We take advantage of our autonomous acquisition system "Giraffe" to develop novel challenging real-world computer vision benchmarks. Our tasks of interest are: stereo, optical flow, visual odometry, 3D object detection, 3D tracking and SLAM. For this purpose, we equipped a multisensors platform with two high-resolution color and grayscale video cameras.
